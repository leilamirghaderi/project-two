      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a graduate student majoring in Technology and Humanities at Illinois Institute of
        Technology. I am also an Architect with M. Arch degree from State University of New York at
        Buffalo (UB). At UB, I had the opportunity to mainly focus on social and behavioral aspects
        of my field which is an inseparable part of architecture but is usually neglected by
        architects. I also have a B.Sc degree in architectural engineering. You can find my B.sc
        portfolio by clicking on the above link.

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I collected a few other skills through my industry experience where I gained practical
        skills to execute my ideas. I worked for a year as a 3D modeler in Mehrazan Consulting
        Company under the supervision of Behrooz Pakdaman, one of the best known architects in
        Tehran. I also worked as a design developer in Sazeh Felez Paydar and under the direct
        supervision of Dr. Mirghaderi, a Professor at Tehran University and the number one steel
        structural designer in Iran.

      <h2>Ambitions</h2>
    <p>
      My ultimate goal is to get my PhD in Technology and Humanities. I want to be able to do more
      research about the ways people give meaning to design by using social media. Hopefully I can
      get a job in a Tech company with focus on social interaction. My goal of developing this
      page is first to introduce myself and research interests to the world and also make it more
      dynamic and interactive for gathering information from users and their experiences.
